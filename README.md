# Hi there, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Lead Software Engineer based in [Saint Paul, MN](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/136612). My primary roles are enabling software engineering teams to thrive with platforms, services, tooling and helping teams adopt a fullstack approach and pragmatic philosophy to software engineering. Beyond that, I help business teams thrive with technology, build engineering teams focused on growth and autonomy, and lend an engineering perspective to management and its pedestrian duties.
